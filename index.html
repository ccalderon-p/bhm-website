    <h1 id="h">Fannie Lou Hamer</h1>
    <br>
    <h5>Fannie Lou Hamer was born on October 6th, 1917 in Mississippi and passed away on March 14th 1977. She grew up in poverty and began picking cotton at the age of 6. By the time she was 12 she left school to work. In 1944 she married Perry Hamer. In 1961 she got a hysterectomy without her consent during surgery by a white doctor. That summer she went to a meeting led by the civil rights activist James Forman. She became a SNCC organizer and on August 31, 1962 led 17 volunteers to register to vote at the Indianola, Mississippi Courthouse but were denied. In June 1963, after completing a voter registration program in South Carolina, Fannie and many other Black women were arrested for sitting in a “whites only” bus station restaurant. At the jailhouse, they were beaten. In 1964 she co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which challenged the local Democratic Party’s efforts to block Black participation. In 1964, she helped organize Freedom Summer to bring hundreds of college students to help with African American voter registration in the segregated South. Her reputation kept growing and she continued traveling, giving speeches on behalf of civil rights.
